Jessica Ax,4 stars,"Tasty Japanese Cheesecake that is a bit pricey but unique.

Atmosphere was bright and cheery. Digital menu board was crowded. Large seating area could accommodate quite a few people enjoying beverages and treats but the only people there when we visited around lunch on a Sunday were vagrants charging items at the tables. A bit off-putting.

Actual cheesecake is significantly different than American cheesecake. Light and fluffing in texture with mild sweetness. I quite liked it. We also purchased a strawberry tart. This had a strange aftertaste that I would not purchase again.

Fun place to try, but a bit too pricey for what it is.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114936444529553554932/reviews?hl=en,5 months ago
Jacqueline Gibbons,5 stars,"I was curious about this place, so I decided to go in and try. Very silky and fluffy cheesecake! I got it with a Carmel topping. It was a mild sweet, which i liked because i don't like super sweet things. It was about $10 for a regular size one. The medium size was about $20 and the large almost $50. [Correction: large is $39.99. I meant to put $40 and hit the 5 instead!] I also got a blended chai. It was more milky and sweet. A nice summer treat!

Nice workers who let me take my time looking at the menu and answered my questions.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106116611208791227560/reviews?hl=en,6 months ago
Celiboy Vega,5 stars,I really wanted to try these Japanese cheese cakes because they look so fluffy and delicious and they are good. I also got a peppermint snow shake which was too and a pistachio tart. I have to say out of the three pistachio tart was my favorite then fluffy cheesecake then lastly the shake. I will definitely keep this place as my go to for my sweet tooth! Thanks again for the great service!

"Stephanie Trecha, LCSW",5 stars,"First time visitor, and I tried the coconut tart, a small cheesecake, and an iced caramel macchiato. The coconut tart was the most delicious tart I‚Äôve ever tried, the crust was cooked to perfection, and the coconut flavor was refreshingly sweet yet tart. The cheesecake is delicious and reminds me of a cross between cheesecake and pound cake. It would be delicious with any number of topping options as well, although it‚Äôs satisfyingly sweet on its own. I can‚Äôt wait to go back and try other tart flavors, and get more cheesecake.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104604420006767330353/reviews?hl=en,3 months ago

Wendy L,3 stars,"Uncle Fluffy has made its way to Riverside to bring us their  take on Japanese cheesecake and tarts.

FOOD / DRINKS
The delicate, light and fluffy Japanese cheesecake just melts in your mouth and is not to be confused with the dense and heavy American cheesecakes. I tried their Original Cheese Tart and their Mango Tart and I preferred the Mango Tart. Not outstanding but not terrible either. The Original Tart had an off-putting ‚Äúit‚Äôs been sitting in the fridge‚Äù taste. Ugh. On a positive note, the cheesecake was good and I enjoyed it. They do have delicious-looking drinks or teas I‚Äôd like to try some time.

LOCATION / PARKING
Uncle Fluffy is located on Magnolia near Tyler (across from the Galleria at Tyler) in Riverside. There‚Äôs limited parking, as the lot is shared by other neighboring businesses within the plaza.

ATMOSPHERE
The shop is decorated in almost all white from the flooring to the walls and to the table; however, the atmosphere didn‚Äôt feel bright or open for me. It had a weird ambiance - almost uninviting. The lighting was a bit dim too (see photo). It‚Äôs one of the things I look for so this was a minus in my book.

SERVICE
Being that I was the only one in the shop, I expected good service but the girl who helped me wasn‚Äôt as helpful as I‚Äôd like. I asked her which items were most popular here but she didn‚Äôt have any recommendations for me.

BRANDING
I like their signage at the front - good font choice. But the box and overall branding wasn‚Äôt up to par with my personal taste in gift-giving. The box itself is glossy but with outdated hues of yellow and brown that didn‚Äôt match the more prettier posters at the front of their store.

Overall, I think it‚Äôs great that Riverside to has a different dessert option like Uncle Fluffy. I do like their cheesecake and would happily recommend you try it!",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102297794768718252584/reviews?hl=en,10 months ago

chad zerbe,3 stars,"My wife saw this place on social media and wanted to try it. We had a Japanese cheesecake, 3 tarts, 2 strawberry shakes, and 1 frozen coffee. I used a dollar bill folded in half (3 inches) to show the size of the cake and tarts. The cake was very fluffy but did not have a cheesecake taste, but I'm not sure if it is supposed to being a ""Japanese cheesecake."" The tarts were frozen and did not have much flavor to them. The strawberry shakes and frozen coffee were very good and very creamy. We enjoyed our time and the food, but this is a one-time visit for us.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102112827371707467613/reviews?hl=en,a year ago
raco califas,2 stars,"Small location with a decent amount of standing area, the cheesecake was fluffy but somehow dry at the same time. The prices are extremely over prices for a large or XL cake that are not much bigger than muffins or cinnamon rolls $27- 35 a piece, not much for your bank. The last issue I had has the asking for a tip when paying, the girl at the cash register literally just handed me the cakes and asked for a tip as I signed out. $70 out the door for 2 cakes about 5""√ó6"" this place is definitely over hype, this was my first and my last time.

Ms. G,4 stars,"I ordered the strawberry shake and it tasted like a citric acid shake without sugar. I don‚Äôt have a sweet tooth but this was not what I expected at all. It was horrific. I would not recommend the shake to anyone. On the other hand the cheesecake was super delicious! It was quite expensive compared to other Japanese cheesecakes around though.

m r,5 stars,"Very clean, modern feeling cafe. Ordered small cheesecake for myself with cinnamon latte; it was a perfectly sweet and fluffy baked cheesecake. I love this Asian style more than NY style so I was very happy to have found this place! It melts in your mouth with moderate cheese flavor lingering afterwards. Very gentle.
Also, I really appreciated that the cashier immediately informed me about a special type of coffee that I attempted to order - the Turkish Coffee. I didn't know that it was very tiny and thick, and I would have been very confused upon recieving if it weren't for her.

Bruja Magik,1 star,Wanted to try this place and finally had the time too today.  We finally got a cake but it's very over priced. $44 bucks for an extra large cake. When we got home to finally try it out honestly it was over hyped. Very dry and bland. We were hoping for something different but it fell along the lines of a plain overpriced souffl√©. The tarts they had were $5.50 each and smaller than a donut. This would be our last and only time trying this place. Just wasn't good at all.

naomi valenzuela,1 star,Very bland and overpriced. Customer service is trash. Waited an extra 20 minutes for my drink that they had forget to make. It would have been longer if I never went up to the counter to ask what was happening. The 2 employees there were leaning on the counters gossiping rather than working. Owner was there and ended up taking a lady's order himself and made sure she got her stuff right away as well as her coffee..that is why our order got disregarded because they attended to her first. The owner then went down to sit with the lady. I see where the employees get their lack of customer service from.,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109339133732880362529/reviews?hl=en,4 months ago

I asked if the poor girl was ok because she looked visibly upset. I don't appreciate an owner or any management treating employees like that regardless if they did anything wrong. I can also tell by the responses to the reviews they are unprofessional. Treat your employees better.

Richard Rios,4 stars,"So I had the cheesecake twice and the pistachio tart once. First time I had the cheesecake it was FANTASTIC the second it was just good. A little comparison between the two first time light, fluffy, wonderful texture, not overly sweet, with a really beautiful hint of lemon! Second time really nice lemon note was missing and texture wasn't quite as good. Not bad just not as good as the first time. For 9.99 per cheesecake I would hope for a bit more consistency. I would happily pay it for the first cheesecake I bought, but if I had been given the second first I would pass as the value wouldn't be there for me personally. The pistachio tart was ok. Crust was a bit overcooked...As I left I noticed a sign in the window indicating they were looking for a baker...in any event I'll go back and do recommend giving them a try. If they can get the consistency down I'll be a happy fairly regular customer. If not the value wouldn't be there for me personally.

Christopher Acosta,3 stars,"It was ok, they were out of almost everything so only got the cheesecake. It was ok, nothing espectacular. I did not hate it, I liked it. I would have it again, but only if I‚Äôm in the area. I was there late so I will be back earlier and see if maybe that was why my experience was sub-par. If it changes, then so will the review.

I was excited because we don‚Äôt have to drive all the way to LA, but the ones in LA are top tier, so hopeful to come back earlier and hope my experience has changed.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106362770454652917587/reviews?hl=en,9 months ago

George Riad,5 stars,"Rafik the owner welcomed me into the place when i tried them out. He runs the cafe with family friendly vibe and you can sense he looks at the team as if they are his kids.

The Japanese cake was flavorful and fresh while their drinks are delicious.

Paul Jay,1 star,"Like many other people, we saw this on social media and wanted to try it. The place looked clean, had maybe 4 young employees and what I assume was the owner, he walked inside, behind the counter and while we started to order he called one of the employees stupid! It was very strange, they walked into the back and we couldn‚Äôt hear anything else. The food and drink was just blah, but the employee being called stupid was all we could think about.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107519712988381020818/reviews?hl=en,6 months ago
Jeff Hung,5 stars,"We were invited here for the pre-grand opening, the decor is very modern and clean! Uncle Fluffy Japanese Cheesecake with varieties of toppings to choose from.

Erica Palafox,3 stars,Got here about 4:45 and it‚Äôs now 5:27pm and everything is almost sold out and literally out of tarts and flavors for the cheese cakes. The ovens should really be up and running especially 3 hours before closing plenty of time to get more done!! Ridiculous how you gonna hype up your business yet run out of stuff not one hour not two but literally few hours before closing!! Management needs to really work on the kitchen prep and inventory for the day honestly biggest disappointment,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116118780235481024985/reviews?hl=en,10 months ago

Jack Adams,2 stars,"I was really excited for this place but I felt that the prices were a lot of what you‚Äôre being given. The cheesecake was okay, but I wish there was more toppings or flavors for the cheesecake besides the sauces. The customer service was also‚Ä¶ not amazing, which caught me off guard.

Like I understand food industry jobs are hard, but I‚Äôve gotten better service at places like McDonalds or Canes where the line is never ending and workers were always on their feet. My friend and I were the only people at the store and the staff made it feel like we were inconveniencing them by coming in.

Overall I understand the business just started, so I‚Äôm hoping the aspects I felt underwhelmed by will improve but at first visit, my experience was disappointing.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115861214292958329766/reviews?hl=en,a year ago
AnnMarie McCoy,2 stars,"My hub and I were super excited to try the Japanese cheesecake at Uncle Fluffy. When we entered the establishment, an employee looked at us as if we were an inconvenience (he seemed to be the boss/manager). He did not greet us in any way and he acted rude.  We should have left, but fortunately, the person who helped us was kind and had great customer service. However, while we were ordering, the boss went behind the counter and started reprimanding one of the employees making the cheesecake in a way that was causing everyone discomfort. I felt embarrassed for the employee as it was unethical and unprofessional. I doubt we will ever return to this place due to the lack of professionalism. The cheesecake and tarts were tasty, but not tasty enough to return!",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103443090905727459533/reviews?hl=en,a year ago
GUS SANDOVAL,4 stars,"The Japanese cheesecake was amazing.  The drinks are good, but the servers don't acknowledge you until they feel like it.  I got the feeling that the 3 girls behind the counter were not on speaking terms with each other. We tried being friendly and screamed out ""thank you"" before we walked out and they didn't even look up to aknowledge us. The owner needs to look into this because you are only as good as your weakest employee.  Good food with bad service is no bueno.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109633093787000300717/reviews?hl=en,a year ago
